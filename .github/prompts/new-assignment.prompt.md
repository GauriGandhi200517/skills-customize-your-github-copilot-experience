# Create New Programming Assignment

Your goal is to generate a new homework assignment for the Mergington High School students.

## Step 1: Gather Assignment Information

If not already provided by the user, ask what the assignment will be about.

## Step 2: Create Assignment Structure

1. Create a new directory in the `assignments` folder with a unique name based on the assignment topic
1. Create a new file in the directory named `README.md` with the structure from the [assignment-template.md](../../templates/assignment-template.md) file
1. Fill out the assignment details in the README file
1. (Optional) Add starter code or attachments if the assignment needs them - add these files to the same assignment folder

## Step 3: Update Website Configuration

Update the assignments list in [config.json](../../config.json) website configuration file to include the new assignment. For the dueDate field, use the current date plus 7 days unless specified otherwise.

## Activity: Test the Assignment Prompt

Open Copilot Chat in VS Code and ensure you're in Agent mode.

Run your prompt by typing `/new-assignment` in the chat input. There are 2 options:

- Type just `/new-assignment` without a description. Copilot will ask what the assignment should be about.
- Include the topic directly: `/new-assignment Building REST APIs with FastAPI framework`

## Assignment Topic Ideas

- Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Building REST APIs with FastAPI framework
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- File handling and regular expressions
- Object-oriented design patterns

## Verify the new assignment appears in the assignments list on the website preview.

Assignment not showing? 🔍

- Review the generated assignment content to ensure it matches your established conventions.

## Commit and push your changes:

- The new prompt file: `.github/prompts/new-assignment.prompt.md`
- The generated assignment directory and files.
- Updated `config.json` configuration.

Having trouble? 🤷

Check that:
- Assignment slug is unique (no spaces, lowercase)
- `README.md` follows the template structure
- `config.json` entry has all required fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `path`, `dueDate`
